// //There are three variables important in javascrpipt
// //### `var` ->  the old way
// `var` was the original keyword in JavaScript. It is **function-scoped**, can be **redeclared**, 
// can be **reassigned**, and gets **hoisted** to the top of 
// its scope with an initial value of `undefined`.

// In modern automation code, we avoid `var` because it leaks out of 
// `if` and `for` blocks, which causes confusing bugs in test loops.

var v = 10;

var browser = "chrome";
var browser = "firefox"; // redeclaration allowed
browser = "edge"; // reassignment allowed
